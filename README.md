# SD-411
The SD-411 CPU is a five stage, fully pipelined core processor for RISC V assembly. The processor consists of an instruction fetch stage, a decode stage, an execute stage, a data memory stage, and finally a write-back stage. The motivation of this architecture design is to increase throughput of RISC V programs by executing multiple instructions simultaneously. On top of the five stage pipeline, this CPU is equipped with a data forwarding unit to handle data hazards, a branch prediction and flushing system to handle control hazards, and an advanced caching scheme to improve the performance of memory operations.
